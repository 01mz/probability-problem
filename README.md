Using python to solve the following problem:

> A bag contains 200 numbers chosen randomly from 1 to 500. "Randomly", at least that's what you are told. You draw a random sample of 40 numbers from this bag, and you find that 11 of these numbers are multiples of 3. Based on this sample, do you think these 200 numbers were chosen randomly?
